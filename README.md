# Toroid-Eagle-Library
An EAGLE library for inductors and transformers wound on ferrite toroids, possibly of interest to radio amateurs.

This library originally was [originally published](http://m0xpd.blogspot.com/2009/12/toroid-library-for-eagle.html) on the CADSOFT EAGLE library page 
way back in 2009 but is no longer on the [list of libraries at EAGLE's new owner]http://eagle.autodesk.com/eagle/libraries.

Rather than waste time by having them lose it again I thought it better to post it [here](https://github.com/m0xpd/Toroid-Eagle-Library/blob/main/Toroid.lbr).

The library includes INDUCTORS (i.e. single windings), AUTO-TRANSFORMERS (i.e. tapped inductors), TRANSFORMERS and Tri-filar wound TRANSFORMERS 
(i.e. transformers with two independent secondaries), on [T37 and T50](https://www.gqrp.com/toroid_data.pdf) ferrite toroids.

The Library has been tested on a recent version of EAGLE (9.6.2) and appears to work OK, but please check that it is suitable for your application -
