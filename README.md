# Toroid-Eagle-Library
An EAGLE library for inductors and transformers wound on ferrite toroids, possibly of interest to radio amateurs.

This library originally was originally published on the [CADSOFT EAGLE library page](http://m0xpd.blogspot.com/2009/12/toroid-library-for-eagle.html) 
but is no longer in the list of libraries at EAGLE's new owner.

Rather than waste time by having them lose it again I thought it betetr to post it here.

The library includes INDUCTORS (i.e. single windings), AUTO-TRANSFORMERS (i.e. tapped inductors), TRANSFORMERS and Tri-filar wound TRANSFORMERS (i.e. transformers 
with two independent secondaries), on T37 and T50 ferrite toroids.
